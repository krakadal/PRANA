**Bio-Digital Market Proprioception & Chaos Analysis**

![PRANA Monitor](PRANA_Live.png)

PRANA is an advanced market analysis core utilizing bio-digital metaphors to process complex on-chain data. It is an **Observer-Only System** designed to map the invisible layers of market psychology, systemic stress, and behavioral entropy without direct market intervention.

## 🧠 Key Innovations

### 1. Neural Tensor (Evolution Core)
* **File:** `evolution_pro.py`
* Dynamic dopamine and adrenaline evolution based on market surprise. The system adapts its sensitivity threshold in real-time, simulating biological arousal and fatigue cycles.

### 2. On-chain Cardiogram (Chaos Attractor)
* **File:** `sensor_onchain_ingestor.py`
* A high-sensitivity volatility expander. Utilizing **Nonlinear Lyapunov Divergence**, it detects micro-movements and structural shifts in liquidity and MEV activity before they manifest as price action.

### 3. Shadow Core (Monte Carlo Behavioral Simulation)
* **File:** `shadow_core.py`
* Executes 100 parallel Monte Carlo simulations per cycle to calculate **Panic Probabilities**. It identifies the transition from "Market Denial" to "Mass Hysteria" using proprietary behavioral weights.

### 4. Thalamic Junction (Subconscious Neural Center)
* **File:** `thalamic_junction.py`
* A **PyTorch-powered** neural engine that processes 12-dimensional vectors of systemic jitter and circadian rhythms. It manages the "Nervous Tension" of the engine, ensuring balanced sensory gain.

## 🏛️ System Architecture

* **Bicameral Mind**: Resolves the dissonance between rational data (Logic) and intuitive signals (Shadow). It features a "Humility Protocol" that tracks cognitive biases like Arrogance and Rigidity.
* **Chaos Attractor Mapping**: Maps on-chain entropy to identify "Event Horizons" where systemic collapse becomes statistically inevitable.
* **Circadian Rhythm Integration**: Simulates natural energy peaks and troughs to prevent over-optimization and sensory burnout during low-volatility periods.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language**: Python 3.9+
* **Neural Framework**: PyTorch
* **Mathematics**: NumPy, SciPy (Non-linear regression & Stochastic modeling)
* **Data Ingestion**: Web3, Dune API, Flashbots MEV-Relay
