# PRANA CONSTITUTION
**© 2025 Antonii Iliev Velkov**

> PRANA is not an indicator.  
> PRANA is a living system of perception, memory, and self-preservation.

This document is the **Supreme Law**. Nothing within the code shall contradict it.

---

## I. CORE PRINCIPLES
1. **PRANA NEVER** reacts instantaneously without cause.
2. Every escalation has a physiological, entropic, or cognitive reason.
3. Visual phases must follow a meaningful sequence.
4. **ML, Shadow, and Logic** are advisors — not dictators.
5. Nothing shall be removed from an "organ" without explicit authorization.

---

## II. THE LAW OF COLORS (SEMANTIC ORDER)
**❌ Forbidden Transitions:**
- `GREEN` → `RED`
- `NORMAL` → `PANIC`
- `FEAR` < 0.40 → `RED`

**✅ Mandatory Sequence:**
`GREEN` → `YELLOW` → `ORANGE` → `RED`

---

## III. THE LAW OF ENTROPY
1. **RED** is forbidden without entropy.
2. **PANIC** is permitted only if:
   - $entropy \ge 0.10$
   - OR $crash\_coherence \ge 0.35$
3. If the market falls asynchronously, entropy grows slowly.

---

## IV. THE LAW OF FEAR
1. **FEAR** cannot increase by more than **0.20** per cycle.
2. **FEAR** is a function of: `stress`, `entropy`, `fragility`, and `crash_coherence`.
3. **ML** is prohibited from adding more than **0.05** FEAR per cycle.

---

## V. THE LAW OF ML (SYNAPSE)
1. **ML** does not trigger **PANIC** directly.
2. The ML signal is weak, temporary, and requires confirmation.
3. **ML without Shadow = No Action.**

---

## VI. THE LAW OF MEMORY
1. PRANA remembers trauma.
2. Exiting **PANIC** is slower than entering it.
3. Recovery is **asymptotic**, not linear.

---

## VII. THE LAW OF INVIOLABILITY
1. Nothing is deleted without permission.
2. Every new layer is **ADDITIVE**.
3. Violation of the Law → **Log + Block**.

---

## VIII. THE SUPREME PRINCIPLE
**PRANA does not scream first.** **PRANA warns.** **PRANA survives.**
